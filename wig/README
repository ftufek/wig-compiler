In order to build, it requires g++ (>= 4.7) for c++11 support.

You can than just execute:
> make code;
It will generate an "fwig" executable in the current directory.

The tests are placed under tests/ folder. 
They are python scripts.
There's run.py inside each folder.

You can run them directly or from the makefile with:

> make check

I didn't implement any unit tests as of now. Because the python
test scripts execute the entire compiler already and if there's
any bug, it's easily visible. It isn't worth putting all the
effort into unit-testing for now...
